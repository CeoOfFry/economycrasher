# economycrasher. reject modernity, embrace crashing the pea economy.

usage:
- copy the contents of "autolike.js" 
- in any PDB board, open devtools (by pressing F12 or right clicking > inspect) 
- head over to the console tab and simply paste and enter the copied contents
- the script will automatically start, the only way to stop it is by refreshing the page

lil desclaimer:
- in some cases, a long time after running the script, PDB may throw you CORS errors (and Service Errors) and make it seem like you got "temp-banned" from the entire site, this is common and simply not running the script and waiting for the CORS errors and Service Errors to stop will get you back in PDB.
